Pull requests are welcome!

I just ask that you keep a few things in mind:

- This repo follows [the "successful" git branching model]
(http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), so you PR should usually
be made against the `develop` branch.
- If an issue doesn't already exist, create one explaining your bug or feature before
submitting your PR.
- The code loosely follows the [WordPress Coding Standards]
(https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/).
- PHPUnit tests are a great addition to almost any PR.
- Have fun.

Thank you!
